## What is SmartMet server? 
SmartMet server is a data and product server that provides access to observational, forecast, and model data. It is used for data services and product generation. The server can host datasets and products from several producers, e.g. the new datasets and products produced in the CryoSCOPE project. 

Both project’s internal and external users can access and explore the CryoSCOPE datasets via SmartMet server APIs (e.g. Timeseries, WMS, EDR) and the general data browser (grid-gui).
