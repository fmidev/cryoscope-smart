## ECSF, ECBSF, ECB2SF

ECSF Seasonal forecasts (SF) are forecasts for 215 days forward updated monthly, with 51 ensemble members (1 control and 50 perturbed members). Each month a new updated SF is added to SmartMet server. 

From Climate Data Store (CDS): 

- [Seasonal forecast daily and subdaily data on single levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=overview)
- [Seasonal forecast subdaily data on pressure levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/seasonal-original-pressure-levels?tab=overview)

See Table below for available variables for ECSF. `z` marks if variable is also available as ECBSF or ECB2SF version.
