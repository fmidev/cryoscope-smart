# SmartMet for CryoSCOPE

SmartMet server is a data and product server that provides access to observational, forecast, and model data. It is used for data services and product generation. The server can host datasets and products from several producers, e.g. the new datasets and products produced in the CryoSCOPE project. Both project‚Äôs internal and external users can access and explore the CryoSCOPE datasets via SmartMet server APIs and the general data browser (grid-gui).

This repo contains information on the SmartMet server for CryoSCOPE: documentation, links, examples. It is intended for users who need to query, visualize, or contribute data via the server.

See https://github.com/fmidev/cryoscope-smartmet for server configuration and workflows.

[Note: This repository is a work in progress during summer 2025.]
